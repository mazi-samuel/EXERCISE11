Given an initial amount and a yearly interest rate calculate the amount of money expected at the end of a period of not less than 5 years. Assume n = 1.
Hint: 𝐴 = 𝑃(1 +𝑟/𝑛)^𝑛𝑡
A = Amount of money expected
P = Initial amount
R = Interest Rate in percent
r = R/100
t = Time Involved in years, 0.5 years is calculated as 6 months, etc.
